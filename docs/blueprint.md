## Original User Request:
I need to create an app for a Glass Company. the app needs to be able to easily create quotes and save them so they can be retrieved and edited and/or deleted if needed. I would select from a list of products defined by a seperate configuration page, each product would have a description and a square footage price. Once the product is selected an additional option will be presented to get the dimensions. Once calculated it can be added to the quote with the option to select more products. There should also be a manual quote field option in case something special needs to be added that is not in the product list. The form should have a finalize button to save the quote and a print button to better display the final result. the app should start with a landing page with three options: create new quote, open existing quote, configure product list. Each page will contain the company logo. A mysql database can be used if needed. Ask any questions needed to complete this task.
